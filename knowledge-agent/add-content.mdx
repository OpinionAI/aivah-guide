## Adding Content to Your Worker Agent

Once your Worker Agent is created, you can continuously expand and refine its knowledge base by adding new content, updating existing sources, and managing your information effectively. Aivah automatically trains your agent on any new content you add, making it immediately available for use.

<Note>Realtime Interactive Presenter Agents rely on a single PDF and do not support additional knowledge sources. Switch to a Worker Agent if you need multiple inputs.</Note>
