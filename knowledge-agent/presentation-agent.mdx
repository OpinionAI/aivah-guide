## Creating and Using Presentation Agents

Presentation Agents are specialized Knowledge Agents designed to present from a single document, typically a PDF presentation or slide deck. They transform static presentations into interactive, conversational experiences.

## What is a Presentation Agent?

A Presentation Agent allows users to:

- **Navigate presentations conversationally** - Ask questions about specific slides or topics
- **Get detailed explanations** - Dive deeper into presentation content through Q&A
- **Access information quickly** - Find specific information without manually browsing slides
- **Interact naturally** - Use natural language to explore presentation content
