## Real-Time API Configuration

Real-Time API enables live, conversational interactions with your Knowledge Agent, providing instant responses and seamless user experiences. This guide covers configuring and optimizing real-time features for your agents.

## Understanding Real-Time API

Real-Time API transforms your Knowledge Agent into a dynamic, conversational interface that:

- **Provides instant responses** - No waiting for batch processing or delayed replies
- **Enables live conversations** - Natural back-and-forth interactions
- **Supports voice integration** - Compatible with voice-based interactions
