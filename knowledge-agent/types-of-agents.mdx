## Worker Agent

Worker Agents are the default choice for most teams. They inherit every capability Aivah offers without extra configuration.

### Highlights

- **Unified capabilities** – Knowledge retrieval, realtime conversations, and integrations are active by default.
- **Multi-modal ready** – Support images and mixed media when your plan includes it.
- **Scalable knowledge** – Combine pasted text, URLs, and file uploads in one agent.
- **Omnichannel deployment** – Reuse the same Worker Agent across chat, voice, and external integrations.

## Realtime Interactive Presenter Agent

Realtime Interactive Presenter Agents turn a single document into an interactive, conversational walkthrough. They are perfect when you need to guide someone slide-by-slide or page-by-page.

### Highlights

- **Guided navigation** – Users can ask for slide summaries, jump to sections, or dig into related details.
- **Polished delivery** – Consistent, on-brand presentations without worrying about a live presenter.
- **Interactive follow-up** – Answer audience questions and reinforce key points using the same source file.
