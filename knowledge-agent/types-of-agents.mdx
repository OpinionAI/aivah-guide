## Agent Types Overview

Aivah now offers two streamlined agent configurations. Each option is optimized for a specific delivery style, so choosing the right type upfront helps you design the best experience.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Worker Agent" icon="rocket">
    Multi-source assistant that blends your documents, links, and text into one realtime, multimodal experience
  </Card>
  <Card title="Presenter Agent" icon="presentation">
    Autonomous keynote presenter that delivers a single PDF while retaining the same realtime tools and multimodal intelligence
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Worker Agent

Worker Agents are the default choice when you need to blend multiple sources together. They share all realtime, multimodal, and integration capabilities with Presenter Agents, but they can ingest many knowledge inputs at once.

### Highlights

- **Multi-source knowledge** – Combine pasted text, URLs, and file uploads in one agent.
- **Same realtime power** – Enjoy identical realtime, multimodal, and integration features as Presenter Agents.
- **Flexible context** – Mix evergreen documentation with live data tools.
- **Omnichannel deployment** – Reuse the same Worker Agent across chat, voice, and external integrations.

### Configuration Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Knowledge Sources">
    Upload files, paste text, or connect URLs. Worker Agents index every source you provide.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tailor Responses">
    Tune behavior in Share settings to match your brand voice and escalation paths.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Integrations">
    Link CRMs, ticketing tools, and other services so your Worker Agent can take action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish Everywhere">
    Generate links, embeds, or voice deployments from the same configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Presenter Agent

Presenter Agents turn a single document into an interactive, conversational walkthrough while retaining the same realtime, multimodal, and integration features as Worker Agents. The only difference is their single-source focus for keynote-style delivery.

### Highlights

- **Single-document focus** – Upload one PDF presentation or playbook that the agent will present live.
- **Guided navigation** – Users can ask for slide summaries, jump to sections, or dig into related details.
- **Polished delivery** – Consistent, on-brand presentations without worrying about a live presenter.
- **Interactive follow-up** – Answer audience questions, call tools, search the web, or trigger integrations during the session.
