## What is an Agent?

Agents are Aivah's configurable AI assistants. They combine your custom content with Aivah's conversational engine to deliver precise, contextual responses. The Agents workspace keeps everything in one place—your sources, behavior settings, and deployment options—so updates sync instantly across every experience.

## Agent Types

Aivah offers two agent configurations:

- **Worker Agent** – the all-in-one option. Worker Agents handle realtime conversations, knowledge retrieval, multimodal inputs, and integrations out of the box.
- **Realtime Interactive Presenter Agent** – optimized for presenting a single document. Perfect for guided demos, trainings, or slide-based conversations.

## Getting Started

Use this sequence when setting up a new agent:

1. [Understand Agent Types](/knowledge-agent/types-of-agents) – Confirm whether you need a Worker Agent or a Realtime Interactive Presenter Agent.
2. [Create Your Agent](/knowledge-agent/create-agent) – Configure basics in the Agents workspace.
3. [Add Knowledge Sources](/knowledge-agent/add-content) – Upload documents, paste text, or link URLs (Worker Agents only).
4. [Tune Realtime Behavior](/knowledge-agent/realtime) – Refine how your agent responds across channels.

Whenever you update your sources, the agent retrains automatically. Return to the Agents workspace at any time to add new material, adjust behavior, or publish to new destinations.
