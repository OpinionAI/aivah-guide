## What is an Agent?

Agents are Aivah's configurable AI assistants. They combine your custom content with Aivah's conversational engine to deliver precise, contextual responses. The Agents workspace keeps everything in one place—your sources, behavior settings, and deployment options—so updates sync instantly across every experience.

## Agent Types

Aivah offers two agent configurations that share the same realtime, multimodal, and integration capabilities:

- **Worker Agent** – the best choice when you need an agent powered by multiple knowledge sources. Add files, URLs, and text and the Worker will draw from all of them.
- **Presenter Agent** – purpose-built for autonomous, keynote-style delivery of a single PDF while still retaining the same realtime, tool, and multimodal features as a Worker.

## Getting Started

Use this sequence when setting up a new agent:

1. [Understand Agent Types](/knowledge-agent/types-of-agents) – Confirm whether you need a Worker Agent or a Presenter Agent.
2. [Create Your Agent](/knowledge-agent/create-agent) – Configure basics in the Agents workspace.
3. [Add Knowledge Sources](/knowledge-agent/add-content) – Upload documents, paste text, or link URLs (Worker Agents only).
4. [Tune Realtime Behavior](/knowledge-agent/realtime) – Refine how your agent responds across channels.

Whenever you update your sources, the agent retrains automatically. Return to the Agents workspace at any time to add new material, adjust behavior, or publish to new destinations.
