## What is a Knowledge Agent?

A Knowledge Agent is a specialized AI assistant powered by your custom knowledge base. It combines Aivah's conversational capabilities with your specific content, documents, and information to provide accurate, contextual responses. When you add content to your agent, Aivah automatically trains it, making your information immediately available for user interactions.
