# User Settings

The **User Settings** page (labelled *Account* inside the product) lets you update personal branding and keep your login secure.

## Profile Images

- **Cover Image**: Click the banner area to upload a new cover. Recommended size: at least 1600×400 for crisp display.
- **Profile Picture**: Hover over your avatar, select the edit icon, and upload a square image. Crop if necessary for best results.

<Tip>Use a professional or company-branded avatar—this photo appears across shared deployments and analytics.</Tip>

## Account Details

The page displays:
- **Display Name** – shown to collaborators and in audit logs.
- **Email Address** – your primary login; contact support if it needs to change.

### Update Password

1. Click **Change Password**.
2. Enter your current password and the new password twice.
3. Save to confirm. A success banner appears once the update is complete.

<Warning>Use a strong password and enable SSO or MFA (if available) to protect shared integrations and billing data.</Warning>

## When to Visit

- Onboarding new teammates—set avatar and name before sharing agents.
- Refreshing branding—update cover art to align with current campaigns.
- Security hygiene—change your password after personnel changes or periodically as part of compliance policies.

Once your account details look right, move on to **Subscriptions** and **Billing** to confirm plan and payment information.
