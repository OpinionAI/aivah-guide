# Billing Dashboard

The **Billing Dashboard** card links to your account’s dedicated billing portal. Use it to maintain payment methods, download invoices, and review subscription charges.

## What You’ll Find

- **Overview Text**: A short description reminds you that subscription and billing details live in the external portal.
- **Billing dashboard Button**: Click to open the secure billing interface in a new tab. Look for the external link icon indicating it will leave the Aivah app.

## Tasks to Complete in the Billing Portal

- **Add or Update Payment Methods**: Keep corporate cards or bank info current to avoid failed renewals.
- **View Transaction History**: Review past invoices, receipts, and credit purchases.
- **Download Documents**: Export invoices as PDF for finance or compliance needs.
- **Update Billing Contacts**: Ensure invoice emails go to the right stakeholders.

<Tip>Grant finance or operations teammates access to the billing portal so they can manage invoices without needing full admin privileges inside Aivah.</Tip>

## Best Practices

- **Monthly Reconciliation**: Download invoices each month to match charges with internal budgets.
- **Verify After Changes**: Following any plan upgrade or credit purchase, double-check the billing portal for the updated invoice.
- **Secure Access**: Use strong passwords and SSO for portal logins; billing information is sensitive.
