# Documentation Tour

Need a refresher on Aivah’s interface or want to onboard a teammate quickly? The **Documentation** card launches a step-by-step Storylane tour that walks through the platform without leaving your dashboard.

## Starting the Tour

1. Navigate to **Platform Setup → Documentation**.
2. Click the **Documentation** button. A modal overlay opens immediately.
3. The Storylane tour begins with the slide titled **“How to use aivah.”**

## Inside the Tour

- **~43 Interactive Steps** – Follow prompts that highlight key UI elements, explain their purpose, and offer tooltips.
- **Navigation Controls** – Use **Continue** to progress or the back arrow to revisit previous steps.
- **Book Demo Button** – Available at any time to schedule a live walkthrough with the Aivah team.
- **Progress Indicator** – Track how far you’ve advanced so you can pause and resume confidently.

<Tip>Keep the modal open on a second monitor while you configure your workspace. You can pause and resume the tour without losing your place.</Tip>

## Best Use Cases

- **New Hire Onboarding** – Give teammates guided context before handing over live agents or billing access.
- **Feature Refresh** – Re-run the tour after major releases to discover newly added capabilities.
- **Customer Training** – Share the tour with clients who manage their own agents in your environment.

## Troubleshooting

- **Modal Won’t Load** – Disable popup blockers or allow Storylane content in your browser.
- **Stuck Step** – Refresh the tour; it resumes from the last completed slide.
- **Need Deeper Help** – Combine the tour with resources from [Support](/platform-setup/support) or schedule a demo via the built-in button.
