# Credits

Every realtime conversation, media generation request, or call consumes credits. The **Credits** page gives you a snapshot of what’s left and lets you top up when needed.

## Current Balance

- The banner at the top displays **Available Credits**—your spendable balance.
- Check this value weekly to avoid unexpected depletion during high-traffic periods.

## Purchasing Credits

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Desired Amount">
    Use the number field to specify how many credits you want to buy. The interface instantly calculates the cost and projected new balance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Pricing">
    Confirm the projected total credits and payable amount before proceeding. If you have finance approvals, capture a screenshot for documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Buy Credits">
    Press **Buy credits** to start checkout. You’ll be prompted for payment details if none are stored.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>Always double-check with the requestor or finance team before finalizing a purchase—credit buys are typically non-refundable.</Warning>

## Best Practices

- **Set Threshold Alerts**: Establish an internal process to refill credits when the balance drops below a certain level (e.g., 25% of monthly usage).
- **Tie to Campaigns**: Before launching marketing pushes, forecast expected traffic and pre-purchase credits accordingly.
- **Monitor Impact**: After large purchases, review the [Insights → Agent Analytics](/insights/agent-analytics) tab to confirm credits are being used as planned.
