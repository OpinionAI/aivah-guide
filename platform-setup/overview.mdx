# Platform Setup Overview

The **Platform Setup** area houses everything you need to manage your Aivah workspace—from personal account details to billing, credits, and onboarding resources. Each section in the left-hand navigation maps directly to a settings card inside the product. Use the guide below to understand what lives where and when to visit each page.

## Sections at a Glance

| Section | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [User Settings](/platform-setup/user-settings) | Update your profile photo, cover image, display name, and password. |
| [Credits](/platform-setup/credits) | Check your remaining credits and purchase additional usage. |
| [Subscriptions](/platform-setup/subscriptions) | Review your current plan, renewal date, and upgrade/downgrade options. |
| [Billing](/platform-setup/billing) | Launch the billing dashboard to manage payment methods and invoices. |
| API Key | Coming soon: generate API credentials for custom integrations. |
| [Documentation](/platform-setup/documentation) | Launch an interactive Storylane tour that walks through key product features. |

<Info>The navigation also includes links to **Support** and other future integrations (AI Drive, Integrations, Telephony, Manage Memory). Those areas retain existing behavior and will be documented separately.</Info>

## Suggested Workflow

1. **Start with User Settings** to ensure your profile and security details are current.
2. **Check Subscription and Credits** so you understand your plan limits before inviting teammates.
3. **Configure Billing** by opening the billing dashboard and verifying payment methods.
4. **Launch the Documentation tour** if you or new teammates need an interactive walkthrough.
5. **Monitor credits regularly**—return to the Credits page whenever you need to top up usage.

## Quick Tips

- Keep profile images current; they appear in shared experiences and dashboards.
- Note your subscription renewal date so you can plan upgrades or pauses in advance.
- Download invoices monthly for your finance team; the billing portal retains history but proactive downloads simplify bookkeeping.
- Watch for the API Key section to go live if you plan to connect custom applications.
