# Chat Bubble Integration

The chat bubble embed allows you to add a floating chat interface to any website. Users can click the bubble to start conversations with your AI agent without leaving the current page.

## How Chat Bubbles Work

### Floating Interface
- **Non-intrusive Design**: Small bubble that doesn't interfere with website content
- **Always Accessible**: Positioned for easy access without blocking important elements
- **Expandable Interface**: Clicking opens a larger chat window
- **Contextual Help**: Users get assistance while browsing your content

### User Experience
- **Instant Availability**: Agent is ready to help at any moment
- **Seamless Integration**: Feels like a native part of your website
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all device sizes
- **Customizable Appearance**: Match your website's design and branding

## Implementation

### JavaScript Embed Code
The platform generates JavaScript code that you can add to your website:

```html
<script>
window.aivahUrl = "https://models.readyplayer.me/68971051680864d7c650276d.png"
window.aivahBackground = "#373737"
window.baseUrl = "https://chat.aivah.ai/base?avatarId=649"
window.contentUrl = "https://chat.aivah.ai/companion/c6b3dfc8-b601-4b06-8f4a-0904a0019e3a?type=face-focus&viewType=bubble"
</script>
<script src="https://storage.googleapis.com/aivah-share/bubble-companion-shared-embed-v9.js"></script>
```

### Configuration Variables
The embed script uses several configuration variables:

- **window.aivahUrl**: Avatar image URL for the bubble
