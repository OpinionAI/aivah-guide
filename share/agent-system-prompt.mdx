# Agent System Prompts

System prompts are the foundational instructions that define how your AI agent behaves, responds, and interacts with users. They act as the "personality" and "expertise" blueprint for your agent.

## Understanding System Prompts

Based on the agent configuration interface shown in the screenshots, system prompts are configured in the Behavior tab of your agent settings.

![Agent Prompt Configuration](/Users/ahmedz/Documents/GitHub/chatbot/aivah-guide/share/Share%20/Screenshot%202025-08-09%20at%201.20.45%20PM.png)

### What Are System Prompts?

System prompts are instructions that:
- Define your agent's role and expertise
- Set behavioral guidelines and conversation style
- Establish knowledge boundaries and capabilities
- Configure response format and structure
- Integrate with knowledge bases and external tools

### Core Components Visible in Interface

The configuration interface shows several key elements:

1. **Agent Prompt (Give Instructions To Agent)**: The main system instruction field
2. **Prompt Templates**: Pre-built templates for common use cases
3. **Knowledge Integration**: "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end."
4. **Initial Messages**: Welcome messages and conversation starters
5. **Suggested Messages**: Pre-written prompts to help users engage

## Prompt Template System

![Prompt Templates Access](/Users/ahmedz/Documents/GitHub/chatbot/aivah-guide/share/Share%20/Screenshot%202025-08-09%20at%201.20.40%20PM.png)

The interface includes a "Prompt templates" button that provides access to pre-built prompt structures. This helps ensure you start with proven prompt patterns.

### Template Categories

Based on the interface structure, templates likely include:

- **Knowledge Base Agents**: For information retrieval and Q&A
- **Customer Support**: For handling customer inquiries
- **Sales Assistants**: For lead qualification and product guidance
- **Technical Support**: For troubleshooting and technical assistance
- **General Assistants**: For multi-purpose interactions

## Knowledge Base Integration

![Knowledge Integration](/Users/ahmedz/Documents/GitHub/chatbot/aivah-guide/share/Share%20/Screenshot%202025-08-09%20at%201.22.02%20PM.png)

The system prompt field shows integration with knowledge bases through context instructions:

```
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
```

This instruction tells the agent how to:
- Utilize available knowledge sources
- Reference specific information when responding
- Maintain accuracy by staying within knowledge boundaries
- Provide contextual, relevant answers

## System Prompt Best Practices

### 1. Clear Role Definition

Start your prompt by clearly defining the agent's role:

```
You are a knowledgeable customer support agent for [Company Name]. 
Your role is to help customers with questions about our products and services.
```

### 2. Behavioral Guidelines

Set clear expectations for how the agent should behave:

```
Always be helpful, professional, and friendly. 
If you don't know something, admit it and offer to find help.
Keep responses concise but complete.
```

### 3. Knowledge Integration

Based on the interface screenshot showing knowledge context integration:

```
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.
If the context doesn't contain relevant information, say so clearly.
Always cite your sources when possible.
```

### 4. Response Format

Specify how responses should be structured:

```
Structure your responses with:
- A brief acknowledgment of the question
- Clear, actionable information
- Next steps or follow-up suggestions when appropriate
```

### 5. Boundaries and Limitations

Set clear boundaries for what the agent can and cannot do:

```
You can help with:
- Product information and features
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Account management guidance

You cannot:
- Process payments or financial transactions
- Access private customer data
- Make policy exceptions
```

## Advanced Prompt Engineering

### Contextual Instructions

![Advanced Configuration](/Users/ahmedz/Documents/GitHub/chatbot/aivah-guide/share/Share%20/Screenshot%202025-08-09%20at%201.20.52%20PM.png)

The interface shows advanced configuration options including:

- **MCP Agent Integration**: Model Context Protocol for external tool access
- **Knowledge Base Selection**: Specific knowledge sources to reference
- **Voice and Model Settings**: How the agent processes and responds

### Multi-Modal Considerations

For agents with voice capabilities (as shown in the voice selection screenshots):

```
When responding:
- Keep verbal responses conversational and natural
- Use appropriate pauses and emphasis
- Adapt language complexity to the user's apparent level
- Be more expressive in tone than in text-only interactions
```

### Real-Time Interaction Prompts

![Real-Time Model Selection](/Users/ahmedz/Documents/GitHub/chatbot/aivah-guide/share/Share%20/Screenshot%202025-08-09%20at%201.21.14%20PM.png)

For real-time models (GPT-4o Realtime, Gemini 2.0 Flash Live):

```
In real-time conversations:
- Respond quickly and naturally
- Handle interruptions gracefully
- Use natural speech patterns
- Acknowledge non-verbal cues when possible
```

## Industry-Specific Prompt Examples

When agents collect user data:

```
Data Collection Protocol:
- Explain why information is being collected
- Request permission before gathering personal data
- Handle sensitive information appropriately
- Confirm information accuracy before proceeding
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overly Long Prompts**: Keep instructions focused and actionable
2. **Vague Instructions**: Be specific about expected behaviors
3. **Conflicting Guidelines**: Ensure all instructions align consistently
4. **Ignoring User Context**: Consider how users will actually interact
5. **Static Thinking**: Plan for prompt evolution and improvement

## Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

Track key metrics to evaluate prompt success:

- **User Satisfaction**: How well does the agent meet user needs?
- **Task Completion**: Does the agent help users accomplish their goals?
- **Escalation Rate**: How often do conversations require human intervention?
- **Conversation Length**: Are interactions appropriately efficient?
- **Return Usage**: Do users come back to interact with the agent?

System prompts are the foundation of effective AI agents. Well-crafted prompts create agents that are helpful, reliable, and aligned with your business objectives while providing excellent user experiences.
