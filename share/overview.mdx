# Share Your AI Agents

The Share functionality allows you to distribute your AI agents and companions to users through multiple channels. You can customize the sharing experience, collect user data, and choose from different distribution methods.

## Distribution Methods

There are three primary ways to share your AI agents:

### 1. Direct Link
Share a simple URL that users can click to access your agent immediately. This is the quickest way to get your agent in front of users.

### 2. iFrame Embed
Embed your agent directly into websites using HTML iframe code. Perfect for integrating agents into existing websites or applications.

### 3. Chat Bubble
Add a floating chat bubble to any website that users can click to start conversations with your agent. This provides a non-intrusive way to offer AI assistance.
