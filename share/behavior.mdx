# Agent Behavior Configuration

The Behavior tab allows you to customize how your AI agent interacts with users, including conversation prompts, initial messages, and suggested responses.

## Agent Prompt Configuration

### System Instructions
- **Agent Prompt**: Define the core instructions that guide your agent's behavior
- Use the prompt template system or write custom instructions
- Example: "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end."

### Knowledge Integration
- Agents can access and utilize knowledge bases during conversations
- Configure how the agent should reference and apply knowledge
- Set up context-aware responses based on available information

## Initial Conversation Setup

### Welcome Messages
- **Initial Agent Messages**: Set the first message users see when starting a conversation
- Default example: "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, how can I help you?"
- Customize to match your agent's personality and purpose

### Suggested Prompts
Configure suggested questions that appear to guide users:
- "Give me a summary of this knowledge base"
- "Can you provide an overview of the main topics covered here?"
- "What categories or sections does this knowledge base cover?"

## Message Flow Options

### Interactive Elements
- **Show initial messages as tooltip**: Display welcome messages in a non-intrusive way
- **Remove 'Powered by Aivah'**: Clean up the interface for branded experiences
- **Hide microphone**: Disable voice input if not needed

### User Experience Settings
- Configure message display preferences
- Set up conversation flow patterns
- Customize interaction styles based on your use case

## Agent Identity

### Naming and Branding
- **Agent Name**: Set a custom name for your agent (e.g., "Presentation AgentX")
- **Companion Name**: Define the companion identity
- **Avatar Selection**: Choose from available avatars or upload custom ones

### Voice and Personality
- **Companion Voice**: Select from voice options (Alloy, Echo, Shimmer, etc.)
