  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Set the toggles:

## Add knowledge (standard agent)

You can add any combination of the three inputs below:

<AccordionGroup>

    In **Enter Content**, paste any short reference text you want the agent to know.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add URLs or videos">
    1. In **Upload URL Or Video**, paste a link (e.g., aivah.ai pages, blog posts, public docs, YouTube/Vimeo)
    2. Click **+ Add another link** to include more sources
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Upload files">
    1. In **Drag and drop files here for agent knowledge**, drop a file, or click **Upload** to pick one
    2. After the upload starts, you'll see an upload banner: "Uploading your Agent Knowledge files. Large files and URLs may take several minutes to complete." Wait until it finishes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>Make sure links are publicly accessible. Very large files/URLs may take a few minutes to process.</Tip>

## Create the agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Click **+ Create** at the bottom of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Agent Settings">
    You'll be taken to **Agent Knowledge Settings** for the new agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

What you'll see there:
- Each source listed with a character count and upload date
- **List View** / **Card View** toggle to switch layouts
- **Export Content List** to download a summary of all sources
- **Add content** button to add more sources later

## Create a Presentation Agent (optional)

Use this mode if you want the agent to present from a single document (e.g., a deck).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Creation">
    From **Create New Agent**, enter a name (e.g., "Presentation AgenX").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Presentation Mode">
    Turn **Presentation** on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Document">
    Upload your PDF in the upload area. You'll see: "Document uploaded successfully. Delete the existing document to upload a new one."
    
    <Note>Only one presentation document is active at a time; delete it to replace.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Click **+ Create**. In **Agent Knowledge Settings**, you'll see the uploaded document listed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Update, add, or remove knowledge

From **Agent Knowledge Settings** (Knowledge tab â†’ select your agent in the left sidebar):

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Add new sources">
    Click **Add content**, then paste text, add URLs, or upload files. Click **Confirm** to save.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bulk actions">
    Use the checkboxes and **Select all files** to apply actions to multiple items.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Verify processing

- After adding links or files, wait for processing to complete
- Refresh or return to **Agent Knowledge Settings** to confirm each item shows a character count (indicates it's been ingested)

## Next steps

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Configure Behavior" icon="gear">
    Head to **Share** to configure behavior and experience, then generate links or embeds
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Analytics" icon="chart-line">

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Uploads feel slow">
    Large files and some websites take time to fetch and parse. Keep the tab open until the upload banner completes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="A link doesn't ingest">
    Confirm it's publicly accessible and not behind a login or geo-restricted.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Replace presentation deck">
    Turn **Presentation** on for that agent, delete the existing file in the upload area, and upload the new PDF.
  </Accordion>
