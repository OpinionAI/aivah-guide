This guide shows how to create and manage Agents in Aivah using the Agents workspace. Worker Agents are the default, all-in-one configuration, while Realtime Interactive Presenter Agents deliver guided presentations. The steps below match the current UI.

## Open the Agents workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Agents">
    Sign in and go to the top navigation, then click **Agents**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Agent">
    In the left sidebar, click **Create New Agent**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Name and configure the agent

  <Step title="Enter Agent Name">
    In **Agent Name**, enter a clear name (e.g., "Marketing Agent").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Choose your configuration with the available toggles:
    - **Presentation**: leave this off to create a Worker Agent. Turn it on to create a Realtime Interactive Presenter Agent.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Add knowledge (Worker Agent)

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Click **+ Create** at the bottom of the page.
  </Step>

    You'll be taken to **Agent Settings** for the new agent.

What you'll see there:
- Each source listed with a character count and upload date
- **List View** / **Card View** toggle to switch layouts
- **Export Content List** to download a summary of all sources
- **Add content** button to add more sources later

## Create a Realtime Interactive Presenter Agent

Use this mode when you want the agent to present from a single deck or playbook with conversational navigation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Creation">
    From **Create New Agent**, enter a name (e.g., "Product Demo Presenter").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Presenter Mode">
    Turn the **Presentation** toggle on to switch the agent type.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Document">
    Upload your PDF in the presenter upload area. You'll see: "Document uploaded successfully. Delete the existing document to upload a new one."
    
    <Note>Only one presentation document is active at a time; delete it to replace.</Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Agent">
    Click **+ Create**. In your agent settings, the uploaded document appears as the active presentation source.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Update, add, or remove knowledge

From your agent settings (Agents tab â†’ select your agent in the left sidebar):

    Large files and some websites take time to fetch and parse. Keep the tab open until the upload banner completes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="A link doesn't ingest">
    Confirm it's publicly accessible and not behind a login or geo-restricted.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Replace presenter deck">
    Open your Realtime Interactive Presenter Agent, delete the existing file in the upload area, then upload the new PDF.
  </Accordion>
