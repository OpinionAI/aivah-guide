## Creating and Using Realtime Interactive Presenter Agents

Realtime Interactive Presenter Agents transform a single PDF deck or playbook into an interactive experience. Instead of clicking through slides, audiences can ask questions, jump to chapters, and get tailored explanations in real time.

## What Makes a Presenter Agent Different?

- **Single document focus** – One uploaded PDF anchors the entire conversation.
- **Guided navigation** – Users can request summaries, ask for the next slide, or revisit earlier sections.
- **Context awareness** – The agent understands slide order and their relationships, keeping answers on-track.
- **Always on-brand** – Deliver consistent demos and trainings without relying on a live presenter.

Presenter Agents support only **one active document**. Delete the existing file before uploading an updated version.
</Warning>

## Optimize Your Presentation File

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Document Checklist">
    - Export to **PDF** with selectable text (avoid image-only slides).  
    - Use clear slide titles and headings.  
    - Keep slide numbers visible for easy references.  
    - Ensure charts and visuals include captions or supporting text.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Storytelling Tips">
    - Group related slides together with consistent section titles.  
    - Add summary bullets to reinforce key takeaways.  
    - Include FAQs or objection-handling slides near the end.  
    - Provide links or appendices for deeper dives.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manage Presenter Content

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Agent Settings">
    Open the Agents workspace, select your presenter agent, and view the **Presentation** panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replace the Deck">
    Delete the current file using the trash icon, then upload the new version.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Processing">
    Wait for the processing banner to finish and verify the character count updates.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>Presenter Agents do not accept additional knowledge sources. For multi-document experiences, create a Worker Agent instead.</Note>

## Delivering a Great Experience

- **Rehearse navigation prompts** so you know how the agent references each slide.  
- **Prepare likely questions** and validate the responses stay aligned with your narrative.  
- **Pair with Worker Agents** when you need deeper knowledge or integrations beyond the deck.  
- **Monitor Insights** to see which slides and questions resonate most with audiences.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload stalls or fails">
    Confirm the PDF is not password-protected, stays under size limits, and contains selectable text.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Answers feel incomplete">
    Add supporting context or summary bullets to the relevant slides before re-uploading. The agent relies on the information in the document.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Need multiple documents">
    Create a Worker Agent instead, or link multiple presenter agents together using share links.
  </Accordion>
