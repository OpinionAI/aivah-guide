## Training Your Knowledge Agent

Training your Knowledge Agent involves optimizing its performance through strategic content management, testing, and refinement. While Aivah automatically trains your agent on all added content, this guide covers advanced techniques to maximize your agent's effectiveness and accuracy through strategic content optimization.

## Understanding Agent Training

Aivah handles the core AI training automatically when you add content to your agent. However, you can optimize your agent's performance through:

- **Content optimization** - Refining your knowledge base for better responses
- **Performance testing** - Validating agent accuracy and response quality  
- **Iterative improvement** - Continuous refinement based on usage patterns
- **Strategic content management** - Organizing information for maximum effectiveness

<Info>
Aivah automatically trains your agent on any content you add or modify. The "training" process in this guide focuses on optimizing your content strategy rather than manual AI training.

## Pre-Training Preparation

### Content Quality Assessment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Audit Your Knowledge Base">
    Review all uploaded content for:
    - Accuracy and currency
    - Completeness of information
    - Consistency across sources
    - Relevance to user needs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Gaps">
    Look for missing information that users might need:
    - Common questions without answers
    - Incomplete procedures
    - Missing context or examples
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove Conflicts">
    Eliminate contradictory information:
    - Outdated policies vs. current ones
    - Different versions of the same process
    - Conflicting product specifications
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Establish Success Metrics

Define what success looks like for your agent:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Accuracy Metrics">
    - Percentage of correct responses
    - Frequency of "I don't know" responses
    - User satisfaction ratings
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Metrics">
    - Response time and speed

  </Step>
  <Step title="Establish Expected Responses">
    For each test question, define:
    - The ideal complete answer
    - Minimum acceptable response
    - Specific facts that must be included
  </Step>
  <Step title="Regular Testing Cycles">
    Run tests systematically:
    - After each content update
    - Weekly performance checks
    - Before major deployments
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Iterative Content Refinement

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Add Specificity">
    **Enhance Existing Content**
    
    - Add concrete examples to abstract concepts
    - Include step-by-step breakdowns for processes

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Behavioral Training

Shape how your agent responds to users.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Response Style">
    Establish guidelines for:
    - Tone (formal, friendly, professional)
    - Length (concise vs. detailed)
    - Structure (bullet points, paragraphs, lists)
    - Personality traits to exhibit
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Uncertainty">
    Train responses for when information is unclear:
    - Acknowledge limitations honestly
    - Offer to connect with human support
    - Provide related information that might help
    - Ask clarifying questions when appropriate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage Scope">
    Define boundaries for your agent:
    - Topics it should and shouldn't address
    - When to escalate to human support
    - How to handle off-topic requests
    - Privacy and sensitive information policies
  </Step>
</Steps>
