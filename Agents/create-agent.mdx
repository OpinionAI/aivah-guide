## Creating Your First Knowledge Agent

This guide walks you through the complete process of creating a Knowledge Agent in Aivah's Knowledge workspace. Once your agent is created, Aivah automatically trains it on your added content, making it ready for use immediately.

## Prerequisites

Before creating your agent, ensure you have:
- An active Aivah account with Knowledge workspace access
- Your content ready (documents, URLs, or text)
- A clear understanding of your agent's purpose

## Step-by-Step Creation Process

### 1. Access the Knowledge Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge">
    Sign in to your Aivah account and click **Knowledge** in the top navigation bar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Agent Creation">
    In the left sidebar, click **Create New Agent** to begin the setup process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Configure Basic Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name Your Agent">
    Enter a descriptive name in the **Agent Name** field (e.g., "Customer Support Agent", "Product Manual Assistant").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Core Features">
    Set the following toggles based on your needs:
    
    - **Real-Time API**: Enable for live, conversational interactions
    - **Presentation**: Turn on only for single-document presentation agents
    - **Multi Modal**: Enable if your plan supports multimedia content
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Choose your agent name carefully - it will be visible to users and should clearly represent the agent's purpose.
</Warning>

### 3. Add Initial Knowledge

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Text Content">
    **Direct Text Entry**

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="URLs & Videos">

## Post-Creation Configuration

### Knowledge Management

Once created, you can manage your agent's knowledge:

- **Add Content**: Use the **Add content** button for additional sources
- **Edit Sources**: Click any source to modify or update it
- **Remove Content**: Use trash icons or **Delete All** for bulk removal
- **Monitor Processing**: Ensure all sources show character counts (indicates successful processing)

You can also switch to **Card View** to see a visual representation of your knowledge sources:

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/knowledge-agent/Knoweldge  /Screenshot 2025-08-09 at 1.14.44 PM.png"
