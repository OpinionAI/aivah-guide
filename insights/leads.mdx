# Leads

The **Leads** tab aggregates contact information collected during conversations—perfect for handing qualified prospects to sales or following up on support inquiries.

## Accessing Lead Data

1. Open **Insights** and pick an agent from the left rail.
2. Click the **Leads** tab across the top.
3. Choose a date range; Today is selected by default.

Entries appear in a table format. If no leads were collected during the period, you’ll see **“No data”**.

## What You’ll See

- **Captured On**: Timestamp of the conversation that generated the lead.
- **Name / Email / Phone**: Fields vary based on the capture form or conversation flow you configured.
- **Source**: Indicates whether the lead came from chat, voice, or a specific share surface.
- **Notes**: Additional context (e.g., product interest, campaign attribution).

## Exporting Leads

- Click **Download all** to export every lead in the current filter window.
- Data typically downloads as CSV, ready for import into your CRM or marketing tools.
- Rename exports with the date range (e.g., `leads_2025-02-06.csv`) for easier tracking.

## How Leads Are Captured

- **Built-in Forms**: If you’ve enabled lead capture during share configuration, the form fields map directly into this tab.
- **Conversation Prompts**: Agents asking for email addresses or phone numbers can automatically store the responses.
- **Custom Integrations**: MCP workflows can push structured data back into the leads table.

Ensure your agent prompt or share settings make it clear to users why their details are requested.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Sync**: Export leads weekly (or daily for high-volume agents) and load them into your CRM.
- **Segment by Agent**: Route different agents to different pipelines—for example, product demo agents to sales, support agents to customer success.
- **Validate Data**: Spot-check newly captured leads for formatting issues or missing fields.
- **Respect Privacy**: Make sure your privacy policy covers any personal data collection, especially for public agents.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Leads**: Expand the date range or confirm the agent’s form is still active in the Share settings.
- **Duplicate Entries**: De-duplicate in your CRM after import; consider adding validation rules to the capture form.
- **Export Fails**: Refresh the page, reduce the date window, or try again with a stable network connection.

Use the Leads tab as your single source of truth for contact capture—then automate follow-up to maximize the value of every interaction.
