# Insights Overview

The Insights workspace centralizes analytics and operational controls for every agent. Choose an agent from the left rail to load its metrics, then explore the tabs across the top—**Insights**, **Privacy**, **Setting**, **Chat log**, **Leads**, and **Call Logs**. Each tab focuses on a distinct area of performance or governance, and most views support date filtering (default: Today).

## Navigating the Module

1. Click **Insights** in the main navigation.
2. Select an agent from the roster on the left; analytics load instantly.
3. Adjust the date filter at the top of the tab (Today, Yesterday, custom range, etc.).
4. Browse each tab for the perspective you need:
   - **Insights** → usage trends and user counts
   - **Privacy** → public/private visibility
   - **Setting** → agent status and credit budgets
- **Chat log** → transcript review and export
- **Leads** → captured contact information
- **Call Logs** → telephony session history
5. Use the export buttons where available to grab offline copies.

Below is a closer look at what each tab provides.
