# Call Transcriptions

The **Call Transcriptions** tab pairs with **Call Logs** to provide verbatim transcripts of voice sessions. Use it to audit conversations, coach agents, or extract product feedback.

## Accessing Transcripts

1. Navigate to **Insights** and select an agent.
2. Click the **Call Transcriptions** tab.
3. Set the date filter to the desired range.

Calls without transcription (e.g., if recording was disabled) won’t appear in the list.

## Reading a Transcript

- Click any row to open the full transcript in a side panel.
- Each utterance is timestamped and labelled by speaker (caller vs agent).
- Long sessions include a scrollable timeline; you can jump to specific timestamps directly from the transcript if playback is available.

## Search and Filters

- Use the search bar to look for keywords or phrases—handy for spotting mentions of specific products, bugs, or compliance terms.
- Combine search with the date filter to narrow results to a particular campaign or incident.

## Export Options

- Many workspaces provide a **Download** button per transcript, exporting in TXT or PDF.
- For bulk exports, use the **Export Call Logs** button in the [Call Logs](/insights/call-logs) tab, then reference the transcript IDs provided.

## Compliance and Governance

- **Data Retention**: Follow your organization’s retention policy—transcripts may need periodic deletion or archiving.
- **PII Handling**: If transcripts contain personal data, mask or redact before sharing with external teams.
- **Quality Assurance**: Share anonymized snippets with training teams to reinforce best practices or highlight improvement areas.

## Best Practices

- **Routine Reviews**: Sample transcripts weekly to check tone, accuracy, and policy adherence.
- **Tagging**: Create a tagging system (e.g., “billing”, “escalation”) to categorize transcripts for faster retrieval later.
- **Feedback Loop**: Forward notable scenarios to product, legal, or customer success teams to close the loop on user feedback.
- **Integration**: Sync important transcripts to your CRM or ticketing system so account owners can review conversations in context.

## Troubleshooting

- **Transcript Missing**: Ensure call recording/transcription was enabled in your telephony integration at the time of the call.
- **Poor Accuracy**: Background noise or overlapping speech can reduce transcription quality—encourage callers to use headsets where possible.
- **File Won’t Download**: Try again after refreshing the page or clear your browser cache; large transcripts may take a moment to generate.

Leverage Call Transcriptions alongside Call Logs to maintain a complete, searchable history of spoken interactions with your customers.
