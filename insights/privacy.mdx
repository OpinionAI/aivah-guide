# Privacy Settings

The **Privacy** tab controls whether an agent is visible to users outside your organization. Use it to toggle between internal-only pilots and publicly shared experiences.

## Accessing the Privacy Tab

1. Navigate to **Insights** in the main nav.
2. Choose the agent you want to manage from the left rail.
3. Click the **Privacy** tab along the top bar.

## Visibility Modes

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Private" icon="lock">
    Only teammates inside your workspace can access or test the agent. External share links are disabled.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Public" icon="share">
    Allows anyone with the link or embed to interact with the agent. Ideal for production deployments or external demos.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Switching modes is instant—choose the desired radio button and the setting will persist automatically.

## Common Use Cases

- **Staging vs Production**: Keep draft agents Private until content and behavior have been approved.
- **Beta Programs**: Temporarily flip to Public for select customers, then revert to Private once the test period ends.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Ensure regulated content stays Private while FAQs or marketing agents remain Public.

## Best Practices

- **Audit Regularly**: Create a recurring reminder to review which agents are publicly accessible.
- **Document Changes**: Note visibility toggles in your release notes so stakeholders know when an agent goes live.
- **Pair with Share Settings**: Public agents often need updated scripts, prompts, or guardrails—coordinate with the [Share section](/share/overview) before switching on.

## Troubleshooting

- **Users Still Can’t Access a Public Agent**: Confirm they are using the latest share link or embed; cache or old URLs may still point to the private version.
- **Reached via Search Engines**: Remember that public agents can appear outside your direct channels. If that’s not desired, revert to Private or use controlled distribution methods.
- **Need Granular Access**: For invite-only experiences, keep the agent Private and share recordings or curated interactions instead.

Privacy settings give you quick control over who can reach each agent—review them whenever you launch new flows or wrap a campaign.
