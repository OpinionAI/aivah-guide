# Call Logs

The **Call Logs** tab documents every voice or video session routed through an agent, making it easy to review duration, participants, and outcomes.

## Navigating the Call Logs Tab

1. Open **Insights** and pick an agent from the sidebar.
2. Click the **Call Logs** tab along the top.
3. Adjust the date range to the window you want to analyze.

If no calls occurred during the selected period, the table displays **“No data”**.

## Column Breakdown

- **Call Start**: Timestamp when the session began.
- **Duration**: Length of the call (HH:MM:SS).
- **Channel / Entry Point**: Indicates whether the call came from web voice, Twilio phone, etc.
- **Participants**: Caller ID or contact information when available.
- **Outcome / Status**: Completed, missed, escalated, or other custom statuses.

## Exporting Call History

- Use **Export Call Logs** to download the filtered dataset as CSV.
- Ideal for record keeping, QA audits, or syncing with telephony analytics tools.
- Add the date range to the filename for clarity (e.g., `call-logs_jan2025.csv`).

## Investigating Calls

- **Hover for Details**: Some columns provide tooltips with extra metadata (e.g., automation path taken).
- **Cross-reference**: Match call timestamps with [Chat Log](/insights/chat-log) entries if the session switched channels.
- **Escalation Review**: Identify calls that required human takeover to improve workflows or knowledge sources.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor SLAs**: Compare call durations and response times against your support targets.
- **Flag Anomalies**: Sudden spikes in missed or short calls may indicate routing issues.
- **Integrate with CRM**: Attach exported logs to customer records for a complete interaction history.
- **Secure Storage**: If call logs contain sensitive data, follow your organization’s retention and encryption policies.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Calls**: Confirm the agent was active (via the Setting tab) and that telephony integrations were connected.
- **Incorrect Durations**: Verify that the user’s session ended cleanly; lingering connections can inflate totals.
- **Export Errors**: Retry with a shorter date range or check your network connection.

For transcript-level analysis, open the [Call Transcriptions](/insights/call-transcriptions) tab, where you can read or download the conversation content tied to each log.
