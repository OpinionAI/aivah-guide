# Chat Log

Use the **Chat log** tab to inspect individual conversations handled by an agent. It’s invaluable for QA, support follow-up, and training improvements.

## Getting Started

1. Open **Insights** and select an agent.
2. Choose a date range at the top of the Chat log tab (e.g., Today, Last 7 Days, custom).
3. Scroll the transcript list to view interactions chronologically.

If there are no conversations in the selected window, the page displays **“No data”**.

## Transcript Details

Each entry includes:

- **Timestamp**: When the conversation began.
- **Channel**: Chat, voice, embed, etc.
- **Outcome Flags**: Indicators such as unattended sessions or escalations.
- **Preview Snippet**: First few lines of the conversation for quick scanning.

Click an entry to open the full transcript within the panel.

## Export Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Export Conversations" icon="download">
    Downloads every transcript in the filtered range—ideal for archival or in-depth analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Export Unattended" icon="alert-triangle">
    Generates a report containing only sessions where the agent didn’t resolve the user’s request. Useful for training targets.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Exports typically download as CSV or JSON (depending on your workspace configuration).

## Best Practices

- **Weekly QA Reviews**: Have subject-matter experts read a sample of transcripts to ensure quality stays high.
- **Tag Knowledge Gaps**: Annotate sessions where the agent lacked information, then add sources via [Add Content](/knowledge-agent/add-content).
- **Monitor Unattended Chats**: Frequent unattended conversations suggest tuning the agent instructions or connecting additional tools.
- **Share Feedback**: Distribute notable transcripts to product and content teams to highlight wins or issues.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Conversation**: Expand the date range or confirm the user spoke with the correct agent.
- **Large Exports Timing Out**: Narrow the window (e.g., export a week at a time) or upgrade your plan’s export limits.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Mask sensitive data before sharing exports externally, or use the **Privacy** tab to limit access.

The Chat log tab keeps every exchange transparent, giving you the evidence you need to iterate on prompts, workflows, and knowledge sources.
