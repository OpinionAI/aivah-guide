# Agent Analytics

The **Agent Analytics** tab (labelled *Insights* in the interface) is the default view when you open the Insights workspace. It surfaces high-level metrics that help you evaluate how often an agent is used, who is interacting with it, and how many credits those interactions consume.

## Layout Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Agent Picker" icon="list">
    Agents are listed in the left sidebar. Selecting one refreshes the analytics panel instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Date Filter" icon="calendar">
    Choose predefined ranges such as Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, or set a custom window.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Credits Graph" icon="activity">
    A line chart tracks credits consumed across the chosen timeline. Hover to reveal exact values.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unique Users" icon="users">
    A counter beneath the graph shows how many distinct users interacted with the agent during the selected period.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Working with the Credits Graph

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a Time Range">
    Use the date picker to focus on the window you care about (e.g., Today for freshness, Last 30 Days for broader trends).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hover for Detail">
    Move your cursor across the line graph to see precise credit expenditure at any point in time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Compare Agents">
    Click another agent in the left rail to instantly load their credit usage, making it easy to contrast performance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>If you are preparing reports, jot down peak usage times from the graph—these often correspond with marketing campaigns or product launches.</Tip>

## Monitoring Unique Users

- Located directly beneath the chart.
- Displays **“No data”** when the agent has not received interactions during the chosen window.
- Combine this metric with credits used to gauge efficiency (e.g., high credits with low unique users may indicate long or complex sessions per user).

## When to Use This Tab

- **Capacity Planning**: Identify growth in agent engagement before extending infrastructure or credit allocations.
- **Campaign Tracking**: Verify that new releases, webinars, or support initiatives drive the expected traffic.
- **Usage Audits**: Confirm that agents set to “public” are actually being used, or see if dormant agents can be retired.

## Best Practices

- **Set Review Cadence**: Schedule a weekly or monthly review of the credits graph to flag anomalies early.
- **Log Context**: Document spikes within your internal notes or analytics platform so future viewers know what caused the change.
- **Pair with Settings**: If usage is outpacing your budget, adjust credit ceilings in the **Setting** tab immediately.
- **Share Snapshots**: Capture screenshots of the graph to include in stakeholder updates or sprint reviews.
