# Setup Your First Agent

Create your first AIVAH agent in 5 simple steps. This comprehensive guide walks you through building a Worker Agent or presenter experience, designing its avatar, testing interactions, and sharing with the world.

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Agent Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Marketing Assistant", "Product Expert")

- **Real-Time API**: Enabled by default for both agent typesâ€”leave it on for live conversational interactions across channels
- **Multi Modal**: Enabled when your plan supports image/video processing so both agent types can use it
