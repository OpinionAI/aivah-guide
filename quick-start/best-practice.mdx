# Best Practices

Master the art of creating exceptional AI agents with these proven strategies, optimization techniques, and expert recommendations gathered from thousands of successful AIVAH deployments.

## üéØ Agent Knowledge Best Practices

### Content Quality & Organization

**Create Focused Knowledge Bases**
- **Single Purpose**: Each agent should have a clear, specific purpose (sales, support, product info)
- **Relevant Content**: Only include information directly related to the agent's role
- **Current Information**: Regularly update content to maintain accuracy and relevance
- **Structured Format**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and organized sections

**Content Optimization Techniques**
```markdown
‚úÖ Good: "Our Premium Plan includes unlimited agents, advanced integrations, priority support, and custom branding options starting at $99/month."

‚ùå Poor: "We have different plans and stuff, premium is better, costs money, includes things."
```

**Multi-Format Knowledge Strategy**
- **Text Content**: Core policies, procedures, and reference information
- **URL Sources**: Living documentation, websites, and dynamic content  
- **File Uploads**: Detailed manuals, presentations, and comprehensive guides
- **Video Content**: Training materials, product demos, and explanatory content

### Agent Configuration

**Real-Time API Settings**
- ‚úÖ **Enable** for conversational agents requiring natural back-and-forth
- ‚ùå **Disable** for simple Q&A or batch processing scenarios
- **Performance Impact**: Real-time adds slight latency but dramatically improves conversation quality

**Presentation Mode Usage**
- **Enable Only** when creating dedicated Presenter Agents
- **Same Toolkit**: Presenters keep realtime, multimodal, and integration features‚Äîonly the knowledge source changes to a single PDF
- **Interactive Demos**: Perfect for product showcases and guided tours
- **Sales Presentations**: Ideal for automated sales demonstrations
- **Training Sessions**: Excellent for educational content delivery

**Multi-Modal Considerations**
- **Image Processing**: Enable for agents handling visual content, screenshots, or diagrams
- **Document Analysis**: Essential for agents processing scanned documents or complex layouts
- **Performance Trade-off**: Increases processing time but enables richer interactions
