# Memory Management

AIVAH's intelligent memory system enables your agents to remember key information about users across all platforms and interactions, creating more personalized and contextual conversations.

## üß† How Memory Works

Your AIVAH agent automatically stores and recalls important information during conversations, creating a seamless experience where the agent remembers:

- **Personal Details**: Names, preferences, and background information
- **Conversation History**: Previous topics and discussions
- **Context Awareness**: Relevant details for ongoing projects or relationships
- **Cross-Platform Continuity**: Information shared across different communication channels

## üí¨ Memory in Action

When users interact with your agent, they can see the memory system working in real-time:

**Example Conversation:**
- User: "Hey there! I have a couple really happy to chat with you today! What can I help you with?"
- Agent: "Hey my name is James"
- User: "Nice to meet you James! What's on your mind today?"

The agent automatically stores "James" as the user's name and will remember this in future conversations.
