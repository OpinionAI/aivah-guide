# AI Drive Integration

AI Drive automatically stores every image or video your agents create through the Hub. Use it as a central media library to preview, filter, and download assets whenever you need them.

## Generate Media from the Hub

Follow these quick steps to produce new assets before reviewing them in AI Drive:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Agent & Model">
    Open the Hub, click the gear icon, and confirm the persona, LLM, and voice you want to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt an Image">
    Type your image request in the scene input bar (e.g., “Create an image of a futuristic city skyline at night”) and press **Enter**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Video">
    Once the image appears in chat, ask the agent to “Generate a short video based on this image.” The clip is delivered back in the conversation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify in Chat">
    Each response includes a thumbnail (for images) or an inline player (for videos) so you can confirm the output immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Access AI Drive

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integrations">
    From the top navigation of the dashboard, click **Integrations**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select AI Drive">
    Choose **AI Drive** in the left sidebar to load the media library.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The AI Drive page lists every generated asset with its creation date and media type icon:
- 📷 for images
- 🎥 for videos

## Filter, Preview, and Download

- **Filter controls**: Switch between **All**, **Images**, or **Videos** to focus on specific asset types.
- **Preview**: Click any row to open a larger preview before sharing.
- **Download**: Use the download button to save files locally or distribute them to your team.

<Tip>Regenerate or iterate on media directly from the Hub chat—new versions appear instantly in AI Drive so you always know which asset is the latest.</Tip>

## Best Practices

- **Name in prompt**: Include descriptive details in your prompt so it’s easier to identify assets later.
- **Version tracking**: Note timestamps or add context in the chat when you generate variations.
- **Library cleanup**: Periodically remove outdated assets to keep AI Drive organized.

## Troubleshooting

- **Asset missing?** Refresh AI Drive; generation may still be processing. Large videos can take a moment to appear.
- **Download issues?** Ensure pop-ups/downloads are allowed in your browser and retry.
- **Need edits?** Return to the Hub chat, refine your prompt, and regenerate the media—AI Drive will reflect the new asset automatically.
